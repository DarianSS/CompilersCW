The dict example is a mistake. All elements of a dict type are pairs.

No multiple initialisations in a single statement because of 

	person d = "Shin", "Yoo", 30, andy = “boss”, “money”, 20;

Void functions should be allowed to have a return statement

Special chars can be escaped in strings. (\" or \' or \\)

Strings("example") can only be binded to seq<char>.

User is not allowed " or \ in their string without escaping with a \.
